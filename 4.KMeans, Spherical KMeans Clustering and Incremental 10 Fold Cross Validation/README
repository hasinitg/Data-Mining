How to run the program:
-----------------------
-The entry point to the program is: finalexperiments.py. It has methods to invoke each experiment.
It first runs experiment in Q1 (see the test case at the bottom) and write word clusters identified at each k for both Wp and Wnp matrices by kmeans and spherical kmeans.
It then runs exp0 which construct 100 word clusters from output by experiment 1 for k=50.
It then runs experiment question 2 (exp2).
Base on the results of that, we can run exp3 (related to question 3) and exp4 (related to question 4).
Other source files are referenced by this for different algorithms such as kmeans, NBC and incrementa 10 fold cross validation.
