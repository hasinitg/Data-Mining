# Data Mining
This repository contains the following list of course work projects that I carried out in the graduate level Data Mining course that I took in Spring 2015, which I enjoyed a lot.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis in R with Yelp Data.

2. Principal Component Analysis and Feature Transformation in R with Yelp Data.

3. Naive Base Classifier in Python.

4. K-Means Clustering in Python.

5. Association Rule Mining in Python.

In some of the above works, I have fomulated hypothesis and analyzed them with statistical tests, which can be found in the associated reports.
